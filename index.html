          <h3>Python Programming</h3>
          <p>Python was the first Programming language I learned, and I instantly felt a connection to it (probably because of its simplicity, yet vast applications). I love developing cool stuff using Python.
             From web to console, I've built stuff in a lot of domains using Python. I love to delve deep into new and interesting modules and frameworks, and my journey keeps going on...

          <h3>Web</h3>
          <p>Developing webpages (like this one) is one of my hobbies. It really excites me, and makes me meet my creative side! Still in the process of learning new stuff in here.
             From building and using APIs, to web scraping, my experience with web is not just limited to design.</p>
